I am a 5th year PhD student at UCLA, with a previous history as a research assistant at Swedish House of Finance at Stockholm School of Economics and the Riksbank (the Swedish Central Bank).

My research interests lie in empirical macroeconomics in general, and I am pursuing studies of micro-level heterogeneity and its effects on transmission channels and aggregate outcomes. I have many years of experience using household data in empirical micro, and I am currently exploring questions of monetary policy using these skills. I also do work in financial macroeconomics.
