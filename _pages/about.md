I'm a Swedish expat living in Los Angeles who spends my free time hiking and cooking. For longer breaks, I go to Stockholm, its archipelago, and my hometown Karlstad. I used to have many hobbies (volunteer work as an instructor in mathematics, member of marching bands and a symphonic orchestra, playwright), but during PhD life, I focus on staying in touch with friends and nature, exercising, trekking, and occasionally playing the trombone.

My Swedish family name turns out to be difficult to pronounce, so here’s a guide to an English approximation.

<mark>**Intermediate level:**</mark> Split it up into Boy-ɛ-reed, where ɛ is as in ''sell''.

<mark>**Advanced level:**</mark> Split up by Bɜ-yɛ-reed, where Bɜ is as in ''bird''

Jesper is pronounced Yes-per, as in ''yes**p**erday'' -- but I don't mind **J**esper.
