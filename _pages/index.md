I am a doctoral candidate at UCLA doing research in applied macroeconomics, using administrative household data, methods from applied microeconomics, and structural modeling to study the role of home prices and credit use in household finance, migration, and the macroeconomy.

I am on the 2023&ndash;2024 job market and my job market paper is available <a href="https://www.jesperbojeryd.se/papers/Bojeryd JMP Should I stay or should I go.pdf#style.css?the=fonz.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>

Using Norwegian administrative data, I study the role of housing tenure and wealth on the decision to stay or leave a region that experiences a permanent change in economic conditions. I find that renters and low-housing wealth homeowners increase their leaving rate compared to before the shock while high-housing wealth homeowners decrease their leaving rate. A spatial life-cycle model with housing and savings decisions explains the results: The regional shock to earnings leads to a drop in regional home prices and homeowners' wealth. The reduction is greater for homeowners with more housing wealth and lowers the value of leaving the location. This causes a reduction in the leaving rate and homeowners are worse impacted by the joint shock in terms of welfare. Renters, on the other hand, benefit from falling rents but the value of leaving has not decreased due to the absence of a wealth effect. On net, they flow out of the region.

## <a href="https://www.jesperbojeryd.se/papers/DP18034-compressed.pdf" target="_blank">A new version of The Housing Wealth Effect: Quasi-Experimental Evidence</a>, with [Dany Kessel](https://sites.google.com/view/dany-kessel-phd-candidate/startsida), [Björn Tyrefors](http://btyrefors.se/), and [Roine Vestman](https://roinevestman.com/)
Empirical studies have estimated a big range of consumption response sizes to changes in house prices. Using a quasi-experiment, we estimate a shock of –19.4 percent to house prices in the area surrounding an airport in Stockholm after its operations were unexpectedly continued as a result of political bargaining behind closed doors. This source of price divergence is ideal for identifying housing wealth effects since it is local and unrelated to variations in macroeconomic conditions. Using a household data set with information on the location of primary residence relative to the airport, we find a short-run elasticity with respect to new car purchases of 0.39, corresponding to a one-year marginal propensity for car expenditures of 0.12 cents per dollar lost in housing wealth. Households with high loan-to-value ratios and little bank deposits respond the most. A quantitative model is consistent with the empirical findings and pinpoints important determinants of the response size, which may explain the variation in previous estimates.
