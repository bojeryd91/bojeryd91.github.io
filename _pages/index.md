I am a doctoral candidate at UCLA doing research in applied macroeconomics, using household registry data, methods from applied microeconomics, and structural modeling to study the role of home prices and credit use in household finance and its role in macroeconomics.

I will be on the job market of 2023/2024.

#  Work in progress:
## The Housing Wealth Effect: Quasi-Experimental Evidence, with Dany Kessel, Björn Tyrefors, and [Roine Vestman](https://roinevestman.com/)
We exploit a quasi-experiment to provide new evidence on the magnitude of the housing wealth effect. We estimate an immediate shock of approximately –19% to house prices close to one of Stockholm's airports after its operations were unexpectedly continued. This source of price variation is ideal for identifying housing wealth effects since it is unrelated to macroeconomic conditions. We estimate a micro elasticity of 0.40 among purchasers of new cars. The implied aggregate MPC on cars is however only 0.14 cents per dollar. The response is entirely concentrated to homeowners with low bank deposits and loan-to-value ratios above 50%.

New draft to come soon, with new credit outcome, a broader sample, and including renters and co-op apartment owners.

## Car purchases, indebtedness and monetary policy
Using the universe of car transactions matched to annual census data in Sweden, I study how the cash-flow channel of monetary policy affects households’ decisions to buy cars. Draft to come soon.

## Heterogeneous effects of QE on corporate bonds and firm outcomes, with Adam Baybutt
Does lowering corporate bond rates by QE in itself stimulate firm investment and other real outcomes? By an event-time approach with TRACE data, we try to disentangle channels of large-scale asset purchases to the firm side of the U.S. economy.

## The marginal propensity for expenditures out of housing wealth, with Knut Are Aastveit, Magnus Gulbrandsen, Ragnar Juelsrud, and Kasper Roszbach
Following the oil crash of 2014, local income and home prices fell in the oil-intense cities on the Norwegian coastline. We study the consumption of public sector workers across Norway and compare their change in expenditures in response to fall in home prices. We argue that public sector workers are insulated from local oil revenue and that differences in changes in expenditures are due housing wealth. Using the universe of digital payments at a high frequency and with information of the type of store, we can decompose the change inexpenditures by multiple categories.

## How environmental tax policy influences car purchases, with Björn Tyrefors and Roine Vestman
The Swedish government has over the late 2010s and early 2020s used the bonus-malus system to encourage the purchases of fuel-efficient cars. The cutoffs are adjusted from time to time, and was in 2022 overnight adbruptly in-part abolished. In the Swedish motor vehicle registry we observe day-by-day transactions of each car, and we use this to analyze how car buyers respond to these changes and their environmental impact, and how buyers substitute between used, new, and different fuel-efficient cars. We also study the welfare transfer between different types of buyers, induced by the price sorting of fuel efficiency.
