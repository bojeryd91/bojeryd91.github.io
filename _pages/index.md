I am a doctoral candidate at UCLA doing research in applied macroeconomics, using household registry data, applied methods, and structural modeling to study the role of home prices and credit use in household finance.

I will be on the job market of 2023/2024.

#  Work in progress:
## The Housing Wealth Effect: Quasi-Experimental Evidence, with Dany Kessel, Björn Tyrefors, and Roine Vestman
We exploit a quasi-experiment to provide new evidence on the magnitude of the housing wealth effect. We estimate an immediate shock of approximately –19% to house prices close to one of Stockholm's airports after its operations were unexpectedly continued. This source of price variation is ideal for identifying housing wealth effects since it is unrelated to macroeconomic conditions. We estimate a micro elasticity of 0.40 among purchasers of new cars. The implied aggregate MPC on cars is however only 0.14 cents per dollar. The response is entirely concentrated to homeowners with low bank deposits and loan-to-value ratios above 50%.

New draft to come soon, with new credit outcome, a broader sample, and including renters and co-op apartment owners.

## Car purchases, indebtedness and monetary policy
Using the universe of car transactions matched to annual census data in Sweden, I study how the cash-flow channel of monetary policy affects households’ decisions to buy cars. Draft to come soon.

## Heterogeneous effects of QE on corporate bonds and firm outcomes, with Adam Baybutt
Does lowering corporate bond rates by QE in itself stimulate firm investment and other real outcomes? By an event-time approach with TRACE data, we try to disentangle channels of large-scale asset purchases to the firm side of the U.S. economy.
